Dear all MTS players:
         I apologize for the worries and troubles caused by the inability to open the DAPP due to this DAPP upgrade to the current stage!
         Since its operation, the ecology has been adhering to the first principle of user asset security. User assets are in their own BSC wallet, and transactions are freely exchangeable in pizza. DAPP is only a mining distribution system, and daily mining is still producing normally, but the front-end shows that DAPP has not yet been opened due to upgrades and other reasons.
         Due to this data export, migration and other reasons, it will take a long time, about 7-10 days. Before the DAPP is open, everyone can trade freely; I apologize again for the inconvenience caused to everyone!
         MTS will go all the way, thank you all for your company! !
