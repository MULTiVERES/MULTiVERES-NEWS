In order to make the ecology more healthy and reduce short-term fluctuations in currency prices, the technical team has enabled the addition of additional computing power to the liquidity pool. A valid address can hold Cake-LP for mining without any operation. The effective address of the added liquidity pool can be checked in the liquidity pool on the USDT-MTS page.
Note: The only way to obtain Cake-LP is to add the liquidity pool of the MTS/USDT trading pair in the pancake. Cake-LP computing power is magnified by 4 times!
